# CliqueProject

An iOS Native App that allows musical artist to reach new fans outside of their usual circles.

What is a clique traditionally?
A group of people such as friends. Often used when discussing stereotypes. 
Stereotypical meaning: Group of goths, preps, emos, punk, etc.

The goal of this app is to have a clique expand it's horizons. When new tracks are added by an artist, it will be randomly distributed among the cliques. This will not only broaden the horizons of the clique but also deepen the reach of the artist.

This app combines iOS Native app with an express/node.js API backend and a mongo database.

The **Superphone api** was used in order for the artist to have a more intimate connection with their (hopefully) new superfans.

The **Twillio api** was used so that music lovers are informed when new tracks hit their cliques.

The app will allow artist to view the cliques that their tracks randomly populate to as well as have a central page where they can upload and "share" new hits.

The fan can see songs in their clique and play them as well as get more detailed artist information and when they do - the artist will get a chance for a more intimate connection via Superphone.
